# The Game of ChamberCrawler3000+ (CC3K)
This is a customized CC3K game designed in C++. This project implements a game that mimics the video game ChamberCrawler3000+ (CC3k+), which is a simplified rogue-like (a genre of video game based upon the game Rogue1 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)). ChamberCrawler3000+ is a game where the player character moves through a dungeon and slays enemies and collects treasure until reaching the end of the dungeon.

### Some Definitions
It is understandable that this type of game may be new to readers of this document. Accordingly, some definitions are provided here to aid in the reading of this document.

*Definition 1*: A **character** is a person/animal/thing in the game of CC3k+. This can be either the player character (PC), who is controlled by by the player of the game, or non-playable characters, who are strictly enemies in CC3k+.

*Definition 2*: An **item** is something the player character can pick up or use.

*Definition 3*: A **chamber** is an individual room in the game of CC3k+. Chambers are connected by passages.

*Definition 4*: A **floor** in CC3k+is a predefined configuration of 5 chambers with connecting passageways. Figure 1 below depicts an empty floor. Note that the configuration is the same for every floor in a game of CC3k+.

*Definition 5*: **Health Points (HP)** is the representation of a character’s health (both enemies and the player character). When a character’s HP reaches 0, they are slain. For an enemy this means that they are removed from the floor and a tidy sum of gold is given to the player character. When the player character has 0 HP then the current game ends.

*Definition 6*: **Attack (Atk)** is the representation of a character’s strength. This is how hard a character can hit another character. Though in CC3k+conflict is solely between the player character and non-playable characters.

*Definition 7*: **Defense (Def)** is the representation of a character’s toughness. This is how hard a character can be hit by another character.

*Definition 8*: A **cell** is either a wall, floor tile, doorway, or passage.

*Definition 9*: Something is **spawned** means that the particular something (an enemy, gold, etc) should be generated and placed on the board.

*Definition 10*: A **1 block radius** denotes the 8 adjacent cells to the character or item.

### System Components
The major components of the system are as follows:

#### Player Character

By default, the player character is a **human** (who starts with 140 HP, 20 Atk, 20 Def). However, the player has the option of changing their race to something more fantastical (e.g. offer different attributes). The options include **dwarf** (100 HP, 20 Atk, 30 Def, gold is doubled in value), **elves** (140 HP, 30 Atk, 10 Def, negative potions have positive effect), and **orc** (180 HP, 30 Atk, 25 Def, gold is worth half value). In our game board, the player character is always denoted by the ’**@**’ symbol.

#### Enemies

Enemies are the mortal foes of the player character. In a traditional rogue-like, the enemy character would have some degree of artificial intelligence. However, for simplicity in CC3k+ enemies move one square randomly within the confines of the chamber they were spawned in. Except dragons, who always guard a treasure horde. Enemies can be one of:
1. **vampire** (50 HP, 25 Atk, 25 Def),
2. **werewolf** (120 HP, 30 Atk, 5 Def),
3. **troll** (120 HP, 25 Atk, 15 Def),
4. **goblin** (70 HP, 5 Atk, 10 Def),
5. **merchant** (30 HP, 70 Atk, 5 Def),
6. **dragon** (150 HP, 20 Atk, 20 Def, always guards a treasure horde),
7. **phoenix** (50 HP, 35 Atk, 20 Def).

Merchants can be attacked and slain by the player character. Attacking or slaying a Merchant will cause every Merchant from that point forward to become hostile to the player character (and will attack them if they pass within a one block radius).

Dragons always spawn in a one block radius of its dragon horde pile of treasure (see Treasure). That is, if a dragon horde is spawned then a dragon is spawned. Upon their demise, any enemy that is not a dragon or a merchant will drop 1 gold. This gold is immediately added to the player character’s total.

Enemies (except dragons, who are stationary) move randomly 1 floor tile at a time, assuming the floor tile is unoccupied (see Section for floor tile description). An enemy can never leave the room it was spawned (created) in. Note that enemies should be moved in a line by line fashion. That is, starting at the leftmost enemy move all enemies on that row and then move to the next row starting with the leftmost. Any particular enemy should only be moved once per player action (e.g. moving to a line that has not been processed does not grant an extra move). However, should the player character be within a 1 block radius of an enemy then the enemy will always attack the player character.

Enemies are denoted on the map as follows: V(ampire), W(erewolf), N(goblin), M(erchant), D(ragon), X(Phoenix),
T(roll), M(erchant).


### Items

#### Potions

Potions are of two types: positive and negative. Potions can provide the player character with positive and negative bonuses as outlined below. Regardless of the potion itself, all potions are denoted on the map with a **P**. A player may not hold any potions. Accordingly, a potion cannot be used unless a player is standing within a 1 block radius of it. The effects of a particular potion are not known until it is used for the first time, e.g. the player character will not know what a potion does until they use it for the first time in a session. However, they will only learn about the effects of that particular potion. Other potions will not have their effects revealed. The exception is for purchasing potions from the Merchant2, which have their abilities displayed.

#### Positive Potions:

• Restore health (RH): restore up to 10 HP (cannot exceed maximum prescribed by race)
• Boost Atk (BA): increase ATK by 5
• Boost Def (BD): increase Def by 5

#### Negative Potions:

• Poison health (PH): lose up to 10 HP (cannot fall below 0 HP)
• Wound Atk (WA): decrease Atk by 5
• Wound Def (WD): decrease Def by 5

The effects of RH and PH are permanent while the effects of all other potions are limited to the floor they are used on. For
example, using a BA potion will only boost the player character’s Atk until the beginning of the next floor.
Note that the PC’s Atk and Def can never drop below 0.
Question. What design pattern could you use to model the effects of temporary potions (Wound/Boost Atk/Def) so that you
do not need to explicitly track which potions the player character has consumed on any particular floor?
